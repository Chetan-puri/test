Apophenia’ is reflected in pleasant and troubling experiences alike – from seeing faces in clouds to conspiracy beliefs
An elderly couple anguish over what to buy their son, who lives in a sanatorium, for his birthday. He suffers from ‘referential mania’, 
believing that everything that happens is a ‘veiled reference’ back to himself. For this character in Vladimir Nabokov’s short story ‘Symbols and Signs’ (1948), the clouds in the sky, 
stains and pebbles all communicate messages that he has to interpret. ‘Everything is a cipher and of everything he is the theme,’ wrote Nabokov. 
‘He must be always on his guard and devote every minute and module of life to the decoding of the undulation of things.’


While apophenia is apparent in symptoms of psychosis – hallucinations and delusions – it is a quality we all share, to varying degrees. 
When someone lies on the grass and looks up at the clouds to find shapes, they are intentionally engaging in apophenia. One specific form of apophenia, based on visual perception, is pareidolia:
seeing faces where there are none, in inanimate objects such as electrical outlets or bell peppers.


Apophenia is the cognitive tendency that helps explain Rorschach tests, sports superstitions, astrology and decisions like selecting birthday numbers for a lottery ticket. Understanding how universal it is – but also the fallacies it can lead to – can help us think more critically about the elements of the world around us and how they might (or might not) relate to each other.
